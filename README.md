Setting up PostGIS always makes me want to hurt someone.

Trying to remember how to do anything like an if/else statement in shell makes
me want to hurt myself.

These are quick and dirty scripts I've made for myself because life is too short
to always be angry. One day I might merge them but for now things are chunked
out by PostGres versions, specifical 8.3 and 8.4.

Patches, suggestions, etc. are encouraged and welcomed. We all have better
things to do be doing that this...
